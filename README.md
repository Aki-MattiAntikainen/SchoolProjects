# SchoolProjects

Purpose of this repository is to show some of programming work I have done during my university studies. 
It should be noted that these files do not compile individually as they are only parts of bigger projects.
The files in this repository are my own work. 

Work from different courses can be distinguished from the commit messages.

OTEKN, Programming techniques - Spring 2017
Purpose of this course was to learn integrating new work to larger existing foundation. Important part of it was learing to use and write
documentation and writing simple unit tests. 
The complete project is a computer board game.

Rinnakkaisuus, Concurrency - Spring 2017
This course taught how to program basic concurrency. The program used multiple threads to turn a RGB image to grayscale image.

Ohjelmistojen Suunnittelu, Software Design - Fall 2017
This course focused on designing and developing a simple game from start to finish. It also included integrating the game to an existing 
interface. The interface used was made by VR(State Railways) and we used the track and train schedule data to make our gamearea.
